        The Siberian Husky was originally bred to pull sleds and carts long distances in the harsh Russian climate.They are powerfully built dogs with lively spirits, always ready for adventure at any time.A true endurance breed, Siberians make an excellent choice for those looking for a dog that will keep them entertained on long hikes.They are gentle and alert, but very social dogs that enjoy spending time outside.
